Changes in version 0.1.0 (2018-07-18)
+ Package created

Changes in version 0.1.1 (2019-01-09)
+bug fixed: bug making the lyso considered as chains fixed in the lipid.miner() code
+bug fixed: bug regarding the count problem for the number of saturation fixed in the lipid.miner() code
+bug fixed: bug making the main class and sub class with a given number of unsaturation not appearing on the network fixed in the lipid_edge_maker() code
+code simplification: the code for the counting of the number of saturation and chain lenght bins in the lipid.miner() code was simplified

Changes in version 0.1.2 (2019-01-30)
+ addition of the non-parametric weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests as part of the options for the enrichment analysis intact.KS(), allchains.KS(), chain.KS(), intact.KS.enrich(), allchains.KS.enrich(), chain.KS.enrich(), total.carbon.cat.KS(), total.carbon.main.KS(), total.carbon.sub.KS(), total.carbon.sub.KS(), total.DB.main.KS(), total.DB.sub.KS(), total.DB.sub.KS(), subclass.mainclass.KS()
+ a dedicated cleaning function was added for the ranking Tables : clean.rankingTable()
+ addition of a plot_ranking()Â function to plot a ranking Table
+ modification of the allchains.barplot() function to accommodate either one or two input tables at the time (instead of two before)
+ all the adjustments of value were replaced by FDR.q-values from the bioconductor package q-value
+ Example datasets were added for the non-parametric weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. The original data is a comparison of the Endothelial cells lipidomics profile vs a global extract from 3 human 20 month donors previously published (Kyle, Clair et al. 2018 Scientific Report). The original dataset is <RankingTableExample>, after cleaning <cleaned.RTexample>, the three object generated by applying the lipid.miner function to the first column containing the lipid list <RTexample.intact> <RTexample.allchains> <RTexample.chain>.
+ The run_the_tests() function was modified to accommodate the new tests added

Changes in version 0.1.3 (2019-02-25)
+ The run the tests() function to make it fully compatible with the Lipid-MiniOn shiny app
+ a bug that was causing the network to not display some of the enrichment was fixed
+ minor code cleaning
